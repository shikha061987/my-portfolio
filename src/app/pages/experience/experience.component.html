<div id="experience">
  <p><b>I have 4 years of experience in the analysis, design, development, implementation, and testing of user
      interfaces and software applications.</b><br /><br />

    I have built multiple personal projects to gain hands-on experience with Angular. I have extensive experience in UI
    development using Angular Framework, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Material Design.

    Previously, I worked for 4 years as an iOS Developer, developing iPhone and iPad applications. Currently, I am
    working as a Management Officer (volunteer) at Lanier Tech.<br /><br />

    I specialize in front-end development using Angular. I have hands-on experience building scalable and modular
    applications using Angular CLI, component-based architecture, and reactive forms. I'm familiar with integrating REST
    APIs, optimizing performance, and writing unit tests to ensure code quality. I also follow responsive design
    principles and use tools like Git and CI/CD pipelines to streamline development workflows.<br /><br />

    I'm a team player with strong analytical, technical, problem-solving, communication, and interpersonal skills. I can
    collaborate effectively at all levels and work independently or as part of a team.

    I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at Liquid Hub, Classic Informatics, and 4C Plus, handling project
    analysis, design, coding, and testing.
